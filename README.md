## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Launches the app in development mode. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page reloads with changes, and lint errors show in the console.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. More info [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Ready for deployment.
- `npm run eject`: Removes the single build dependency, copying all config files and dependencies directly into your project for full control.
